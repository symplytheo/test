Sure! To reverse the order of the expression where the operators come before the operands, you can modify the `calculate` function as follows:

```javascript
function calculate(expression) {
  const stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < expression.length; i++) {
    const current = expression[i];

    if (typeof current === 'number') {
      stack.push(current);
    } else if (typeof current === 'string') {
      const operand2 = stack.pop();
      const operand1 = stack.pop();

      if (current === '+') {
        stack.push(operand1 + operand2);
      } else if (current === '-') {
        stack.push(operand1 - operand2);
      } else if (current === '*') {
        stack.push(operand1 * operand2);
      } else if (current === '/') {
        stack.push(operand1 / operand2);
      }
    }
  }

  return stack.pop();
}

// Test cases
console.log(calculate(['+', 3, 4])); // Output: 7
console.log(calculate(['-', 3, '*', 4, 5])); // Output: -17
console.log(calculate(['*', '+', 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 35
console.log(calculate(['/', '-', 3, 4, '+', 5, 2])); // Output: -1
```

In this modified code, the `calculate` function iterates over the elements of the `expression` array in the forward order. The operands are popped from the stack in the reverse order, ensuring that the operators come before the operands. The arithmetic operations are performed accordingly, and the final result is returned.

Now you can use this code to perform arithmetic operations with the operators before the operands. Let me know if you have any further questions!
